# **App Name**: Visionary Capture

## Core Features:

- Smart Capture: Capture the full screen, a selected window, or a custom area of the screen.
- Screen Recording: Record the screen as a video, capturing the entire screen, a specific window, or a custom area.
- Image Editor: Provide an interface for editing screenshots with tools like cropping, annotations, and text overlays.
- Smart Redaction Tool: Automatically detect and blur sensitive information (like email addresses, phone numbers, credit card, etc.) from screenshots.
- Text Extraction Tool: Utilize OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from screenshots, making it editable and searchable.
- File Manager: Organize captures with tagging, search functionality, and smart albums based on content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate Blue (#737CA1) to evoke feelings of professionalism and focus.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5). It provides a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#B19CD9) to provide contrast while maintaining the visual unity with the primary color.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif. Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif
- Use a set of simple, consistent icons in a line art style, with the Soft Lavender (#B19CD9) accent color as the active or highlighted state.
- Emphasize a clear, intuitive layout, separating capture functions from editing tools.
- Incorporate subtle animations for user feedback (e.g., a brief highlight or movement on capture) to enhance user interaction.
